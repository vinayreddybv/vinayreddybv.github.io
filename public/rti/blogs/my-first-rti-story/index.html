Ask questions. Demand accountability.\nLet transparency be your weapon and truth your shield.\n",

<p>In an era when digital systems are designed to make government services transparent and efficient, corruption still finds ways to hide in the shadows. This is the story of how a citizen’s simple attempt to surrender a PAN card turned into a quiet yet powerful stand against bribery — and how the Right to Information (RTI) Act became the tool that ensured justice prevailed.</p>

<h4 id="the-beginning">The Beginning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-beginning">#</a></h4>
<p>In November 2024, a citizen decided to surrender their PAN (Permanent Account Number) for personal reasons. Since possessing multiple PANs is illegal, the process was meant to be straightforward: fill out the form, submit it, and wait for official processing.</p>
<p>But what happened next revealed a darker side of the system.</p>
<p>Instead of handling the request professionally, the Income Tax officer responsible demanded a bribe of ₹15,000 to “complete the process.” For someone who had followed every rule, the demand was shocking — a harsh reminder that even in a digital age, corruption can persist behind bureaucratic walls.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="taking-a-stand">Taking a Stand<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#taking-a-stand">#</a></h4>
<p>Rather than giving in, the citizen chose integrity over convenience.<br>
In January 2025, they filed a <strong>Right to Information (RTI)</strong> application seeking:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current status of their PAN surrender request</li>
<li>Reasons for the delay</li>
<li>Any internal notes or correspondence related to the case</li>
</ul>
<p>It was not an act of aggression — just a calm, firm request for transparency.</p>
<p>That simple action changed everything.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-outcome">The Outcome<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-outcome">#</a></h4>
<p>Once the RTI application reached the department, the system was compelled to respond.<br>
An internal inquiry was initiated, and soon, the truth surfaced — the officer had indeed acted unethically. The department took swift corrective measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The newly created duplicate PAN (issued due to the mishandling) was cancelled</li>
<li>The official records were corrected</li>
<li>The surrender request was lawfully processed</li>
</ul>
<p>What began as a frustrating ordeal ended as a <strong>victory for transparency and accountability</strong>.</p>
