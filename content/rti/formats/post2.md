### A Battle Against Corruption: How an RTI Brought the Truth to Light

In an age when most government processes are digitized, one expects efficiency and transparency. Yet, corruption still finds ways to slip through the cracks.  
This is the story of how a routine PAN card surrender turned into a quiet but determined stand against bribery ‚Äî and how the Right to Information (RTI) Act became the weapon of choice for justice.

#### The Beginning

It started in **November 2024**, when a citizen applied to surrender a PAN (Permanent Account Number) for legitimate reasons.  
The process was simple: fill out the prescribed form, submit it online or at the Income Tax office, and wait for confirmation.

But the experience took an unpleasant turn. Instead of completing the process, the concerned officer allegedly demanded a **‚Çπ15,000 bribe** to ‚Äúmove the file.‚Äù  
For someone who had followed every rule, the demand was both shocking and disheartening ‚Äî a reminder that even digital systems can‚Äôt always eliminate human malpractice.

#### Taking a Stand

Refusing to give in, the citizen decided to act lawfully. In **January 2025**, an **RTI application** was filed with the Income Tax Department.  
The request was simple ‚Äî details about the status of the application, reasons for delay, and any internal correspondence related to the case.

It wasn‚Äôt a confrontation, just a firm question backed by the **RTI Act, 2005** ‚Äî a tool designed to make governance transparent and accountable.

#### The Turning Point

Once the RTI reached the department, things began to move swiftly.  
An internal review revealed irregularities in the handling of the PAN surrender.  
Soon after, corrective measures were taken ‚Äî the **duplicate PAN** (erroneously created during the delay) was cancelled, records were corrected, and the **original surrender request** was processed properly.

The bribe demand was exposed, and the officer faced departmental scrutiny.

---

#### The Outcome

What began as frustration ended as a quiet victory for fairness and transparency.  
One citizen‚Äôs courage to question wrongdoing not only resolved a personal issue but also shed light on unethical behavior that might have gone unchecked.

This case demonstrates that the **RTI Act isn‚Äôt just paperwork ‚Äî it‚Äôs power.**  
It empowers ordinary people to challenge delay, seek answers, and hold public servants accountable.

#### A Message for Every Citizen

You don‚Äôt need protests or long legal battles to fight corruption.  
Sometimes, it starts with simply **asking the right question in the right way**.  

If you ever face an unfair demand or unexplained delay, **don‚Äôt pay ‚Äî and don‚Äôt stay silent.**  
File an RTI. Let transparency be your voice, and accountability your goal.

*One honest step can ripple far beyond a single case ‚Äî strengthening the system for everyone.*
