Yet, corruption still finds ways to slip through the cracks.\nThis is the story of how a routine PAN card surrender turned into a quiet but determined stand against bribery ‚Äî and how the Right to Information (RTI) Act became the weapon of choice for justice.\nThe Beginning It started in November 2024, when a citizen applied to surrender a PAN (Permanent Account Number) for legitimate reasons.\nThe process was simple: fill out the prescribed form, submit it online or at the Income Tax office, and wait for confirmation.\nBut the experience took an unpleasant turn.

In January 2025, an RTI application was filed with the Income Tax Department.\nThe request was simple ‚Äî details about the status of the application, reasons for delay, and any internal correspondence related to the case.\nIt wasn‚Äôt a confrontation, just a firm question backed by the RTI Act, 2005 ‚Äî a tool designed to make governance transparent and accountable.\nThe Turning Point Once the RTI reached the department, things began to move swiftly.\nAn internal review revealed irregularities in the handling of the PAN surrender.\nSoon after, corrective measures were taken ‚Äî the duplicate PAN (erroneously created during the delay) was cancelled, records were corrected, and the original surrender request was processed properly.\nThe bribe demand was exposed, and the officer faced departmental scrutiny.\nThe Outcome What began as frustration ended as a quiet victory for fairness and transparency.\nOne citizen‚Äôs courage to question wrongdoing not only resolved a personal issue but also shed light on unethical behavior that might have gone unchecked.\nThis case demonstrates that the RTI Act isn‚Äôt just paperwork ‚Äî it‚Äôs power.\nIt empowers ordinary people to challenge delay, seek answers, and hold public servants accountable.\nA Message for Every Citizen You don‚Äôt need protests or long legal battles to fight corruption.\nSometimes, it starts with simply asking the right question in the right way.\nIf you ever face an unfair demand or unexplained delay, don‚Äôt pay ‚Äî and don‚Äôt stay silent.\nFile an RTI.
